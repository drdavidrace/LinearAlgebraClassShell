#  Read Routines For JSON Inputs for Linear Algebra Education Classes

This directory contains a set of routines to read json files for use in a Linear Algebra classroom environment.  This is set up as a means for students to run tests without using Jupyter.  The graphics is more rudimentary and using Jupyter, but it is sometimes easier for students to use a standard python3 environment than loading the Jupyter environment.  While we would like for this to be completely self documenting in the json file, the user must tie the code that will use the json input to the variables in the code.

It is highly recommended that the user use the same names as the variables in the code; however, that is not a requirement.
