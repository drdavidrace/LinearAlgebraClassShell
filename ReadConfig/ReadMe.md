#  Reading Config Files For Linear Algebra

This set of routines is designed to _"standardize"_ a way to read .ini files for python code for a Linear Algebra class.  Because it is specific for providing inputs to a Linear Algebra class, it doesn't try to set environment variables.  Rather these routines are used to input variables for small Linear Algebra problems in an efficient manner.

As part of the standard process, this includes the _"test"_ subdirectory to provide test cases for the ability to read input for the problems.  These tests may not provide 100% coverage, but they will improve with usage.
